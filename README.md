![alt text](https://github.com/bertagnolli/framexNomad/blob/main/Deskee_frameside2.png?raw=true)

This repository includes the sub-project folders for the Nomad Proof-of-concept:

- React client Front-end used by the user to connect to their wallets, list NFTs contained in wallet and synchronise with Nomad portable Frame.
- Nomad endpoint server
- Nomad front-end project that will run on the actual Nomad portable device.

What is Nomad?
Nomad is a disruptive solution that is not only portable, but also secure, mutable and automatically proves ownership of the NFTs being displayed whilst remaining affordable. An all-in-one solution that is heads and shoulders above any of the existing competitors!
